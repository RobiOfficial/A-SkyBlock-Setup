# Introduction
This server was created as part of a project, and now I allow server owners to use it. I update this setup as a hobby and, of course, at the request of server owners or developers (in the discussion forum) I also make other updates.

**IMPORTANT!**
- Let me know about server problems here on the project page. Create a new "**[Issue](https://github.com/RobiOfficial/A-SkyBlock-Setup/issues)**" to get the problem fixed. Remember that I am running this project as a hobby and I may not be able to solve all the problems.
- If you have a question or suggestion, you can create it on the "**[Issues](https://github.com/RobiOfficial/A-SkyBlock-Setup/issues)**" page or in the project **[discussions](https://github.com/RobiOfficial/A-SkyBlock-Setup/discussions)** forum.
